# Project 2: GitHub Hackaton 2021/22

Four days of creative exploration using the GitHub GraphQL API as the outset.

## üìù Concept

An automagically generated portfolio page based on your github repository, with data from the repositories, description as introductory text and profile image.

## üî¥ Live demo

[Demo](https://minor-project-2-2122.herokuapp.com/)

### Dependencies
We've used a couple of dependencies to create and run this project:

* [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
* [ejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs)
* [graphql.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@octokit/graphql)
* [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

## Github GraphQL
GraphQL is a data query language. The specification determines the validity of the schema on the API server. The schema determines the validity of client calls. The shape of a GraphQL call mirrors the shape of the JSON data it returns. Nested fields let you query for and receive only the data you specify in a single round trip.

How we used GraphQL:

```JavaScript
    user(login: "Hoa0") {
        repositories(affiliations: OWNER, first: 100, privacy: PUBLIC, orderBy: {field: UPDATED_AT, direction: DESC}, isFork: false) {
          edges {
            node {
              name
              description
              pushedAt
              url
              homepageUrl
              openGraphImageUrl
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

<!-- Here are some hints for your project! -->

<!-- Start out with a title and a description -->

<!-- Add a nice image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend üì∏ -->

<!-- Add a link to your live demo in Github Pages üåê-->

<!-- replace the code in the /docs folder with your own, so you can showcase your work with GitHub Pages üåç -->

<!-- Maybe a table of contents here? üìö -->

<!-- ‚òùÔ∏è replace this description with a description of your own work -->

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? ü§ì -->

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features ü§î -->

<!-- ...you should implement an explanation of client- server rendering choices üçΩ -->

<!-- ...and an activity diagram including the Service Worker üìà -->

<!-- This would be a good place for a list of enhancements to optimize the critical render path implemented your app  -->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ‚úÖ -->

<!-- We all stand on the shoulders of giants, please link all the sources you used in to create this project. -->

<!-- How about a license here? When in doubt use GNU GPL v3. üìú  -->
